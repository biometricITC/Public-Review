== Introduction

This is an announcement of a public review period for the PP-Module and the PP-Module Supporting Document from the BIO-iTC. As the change to the PP-Module and Supporting Document is to add a requirement to better link how PAD is claimed (or not claimed) to accomodate that additional PAD toolboxes that are being created, this change is felt to not need as long a review period before publication. As such the document is immediately being placed into the Proposed Draft stage of review.

This document will provide information about where to find the documents, how to provide feedback and information about the current status of the documents.

Please email px-isec-itc-bio-info@ipa.go.jp if there are any questions about the Review process.

The latest status of the Review Period, including the latest copies of any documents, can be found at the https://biometricitc.github.io/[Biometrics Security iTC page].

=== Review Process
There are two ways to contribute comments and suggestions to the iTC. The first is through GitHub, the second by spreadsheet. It should be noted however that comments that are received via the spreadsheet will be added to the GitHub platform to allow for a comprehensive discussion. Also, feedback for comments is only provided via the answers in the GitHub comments. 

Each comment should have a suggested resolution be proposed if a change is needed to the document.

==== GitHub Review Process
To use GitHub to submit comments, you must have a GitHub account (and it is assumed you know how to use GitHub). Each comment should be submitted as an individual https://github.com/biometricITC/cPP-biometrics/issues[Issue] with the Label "Public Review" assigned. Pull Requests created for any issues will be linked to these Issues for traceability.

==== Comment Matrix Spreadsheet Review Process
In the <<SupDocTable>> table there is a link to the Comment Matrix spreadsheet. There are instructions for using the Matrix on the second worksheet. Please create a separate copy of the spreadsheet for each document.

Email the spreadsheets to px-isec-itc-bio-info@ipa.go.jp.

== Additional Notes
The specific updates to these documents focus on three areas. These should be the primary focus of the review.

* Updates to the Attack Potential Table to incorporate additional values. These will be used for all toolboxes. They are based on current ISO proposals which will be used if there are differences when they are published.
* The addition of PP-Module Annexes for supporting higher levels of PAD testing. These PP-Modules bring in scope-limited justifications for higher level testing at AVA_VAN.2 and AVA_VAN.3 while these toolboxes are available and in process. This is based on the updated CC:2022 multi-assurance functionality, but as it is still new, this should be reviewed more closely.
